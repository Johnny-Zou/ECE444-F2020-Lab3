<strong>Briefly summarize the difference between SQL or NoSQL database</strong>\
SQL databases are based on the relational model and store data in tables with fixed columns and variable length rows. NoSQL databases have less structured data and instead store key value pairs in documents. With SQL, tables can be linked together via foreign and primary keys, thus avoiding data duplication. With NoSQL, such join operations do not exist and instead data is duplicated, which can allow for faster querying but more expensive updating operations.
